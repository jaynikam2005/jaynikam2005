# Hi, I'm Jayesh Nikam 👋

🚀 **Backend Software Engineer (Java | Spring Boot)**  
Focused on building clean, scalable backend systems with strong fundamentals and real-world engineering practices.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student preparing for **backend software engineering roles** with a focus on **Java, object-oriented design, REST APIs, and system fundamentals**.

I approach learning by:
- Understanding fundamentals before frameworks
- Writing clean, readable backend code
- Building small systems end-to-end and improving them iteratively

My goal is to grow into a **reliable backend engineer** who understands how real production systems are designed, built, and maintained.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus (2026 Track)

- Java (core + OOP)
- Backend development with **Spring Boot**
- REST API design
- Databases & SQL
- Authentication & authorization
- System design fundamentals
- AI-enabled backend features (API integration, not ML research)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Java (Primary)
- Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- JPA / Hibernate

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL (basics)

**Tools & Practices**
- Git & GitHub
- Maven
- Linux basics
- Docker (learning)

**AI Integration**
- LLM APIs (OpenAI / Gemini)
- Backend orchestration for AI-powered features

## 📂 Projects & Code

This GitHub profile documents my journey of building **backend-focused projects**, starting from strong Java fundamentals and moving toward production-style backend services.

Current work includes:
- Java basics & OOP practice
- Backend-oriented class design
- Clean coding and modular structure

Upcoming projects:
- Spring Boot REST API with authentication
- Database-backed backend services
- Scalable backend features
- AI-powered backend endpoints

---

## 📌 Learning & Experience

Before fully committing to backend engineering, I worked on **Python-based data processing and ETL-style scripts**.  
This helped me develop a solid understanding of:
- Data flow in backend systems
- Input validation and error handling
- Backend responsibility boundaries

That experience now supports my backend work rather than defining my role.

---

## 🌱 Engineering Philosophy

- Fundamentals > frameworks
- Clarity > cleverness
- Consistency > speed

I prefer building fewer things well instead of many things poorly.
