## 👋 About Me

I am a **Computer Engineering student (Class of 2026)** actively training as a **Data Engineer**, focused on building **production-grade data systems** rather than toy projects.

My learning and work are centered around:
- Designing **scalable batch and streaming pipelines**
- Building **analytics-ready data warehouses**
- Engineering **AI-ready data platforms** (feature pipelines, vector ingestion, RAG support)
- Understanding **system design trade-offs, failures, and cost-performance decisions**

I care deeply about **how data systems behave in production**, not just how tools work in isolation.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (2026–2027)

- Building **end-to-end data platforms** using Python, SQL, Spark, Kafka, and AWS  
- Strengthening **data engineering system design** (batch, streaming, cloud-native)
- Learning **AI-first data engineering** (feature pipelines, vector databases, LLM ingestion)
- Preparing for **entry-level Data Engineer / Data Platform Engineer roles**

---

## 🧠 Core Skill Set (Focused & Honest)

### Programming & Querying
- Python (data pipelines, ETL, validation)
- SQL (analytics queries, window functions, modeling)

### Data Engineering
- Batch processing (ETL, ELT, incremental loads)
- Streaming fundamentals (event-driven pipelines)
- Data quality & schema evolution
- Dimensional modeling (fact & dimension tables)

### Big Data & Processing
- Apache Spark (DataFrames, Spark SQL, partitioning)
- Performance & scalability fundamentals

### Cloud & Orchestration
- AWS: S3, IAM, Glue / EMR, Redshift
- Apache Airflow (DAGs, retries, dependencies)

### Analytics Engineering

- Feature pipeline fundamentals
- Vector database ingestion concepts
- RAG-ready data architectures

### Tooling
- Git & GitHub
- Docker (basics)
- Linux / CLI fundamentals

## 🚀 Flagship Projects (Production-Style)

> These projects are designed to mirror **real data engineering work**, not tutorials.

### 1️⃣ Cloud Batch Data Lake (AWS + Spark)
**Problem:** Analytics teams need reliable, scalable historical data.

**What I Built**
- Raw → Clean → Curated data layers on S3  
- Spark-based batch transformations  
- Partitioned storage for query efficiency  
- Data validation & idempotent processing  

**Concepts Demonstrated**
- Batch system design  
- Schema evolution  
- Cost vs performance trade-offs

### 2️⃣ Real-Time Streaming Pipeline (Kafka + Spark)
**Problem:** Business metrics require near real-time visibility.

**What I Built**
- Event producer → Kafka topics  
- Spark Structured Streaming aggregations  
- Handling late-arriving & duplicate events  

**Concepts Demonstrated**
- Event time vs processing time  
- Exactly-once vs at-least-once semantics  

🔗 GitHub: *(link coming soon)*

### 3️⃣ Analytics Warehouse & Metrics Layer (SQL + dbt)
**Problem:** Analysts need trustworthy, well-modeled data.

**What I Built**
- Fact & dimension tables  
- Incremental models  
- Data tests & documentation  

**Concepts Demonstrated**
- Dimensional modeling  
- KPI correctness  
- Analytics engineering practices  

🔗 GitHub: *(link coming soon)*

### 4️⃣ AI-Ready Data Platform (In Progress)
**Problem:** AI systems fail without high-quality, well-served data.

**What I’m Building**
- Feature ingestion pipelines  
- Vector embedding storage  
- RAG-ready data architecture  

**Concepts Demonstrated**
- ML vs data engineering responsibilities  
- Data freshness & drift awareness  

🔗 GitHub: *(planned)*

---

## 🧩 System Design Focus

I actively practice **data engineering system design**, including:
- Batch vs streaming trade-offs  
- Failure handling & backfills  
- Cost-aware cloud architecture  
- Scaling data pipelines responsibly  

I prioritize **clear data flow explanations** over tool-heavy answers.

---

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

I follow a strict execution model:

**Course → Documentation → Build → Break → Explain → Repeat**

This ensures:
- No shallow learning  
- Strong fundamentals  
- Interview-ready explanations  

---

## 📈 What I’m Working Toward

- Entry-level **Data Engineer / Data Platform Engineer** roles  
- Teams building **large-scale data systems**
- Environments where **engineering rigor matters**
